                        <p>To talk about the art of the 20th century and all its famous painters is to talk about an exciting, complex, groundbreaking avant-garde period in the history of arts that had broken away from tradition and changed the way we comprehend the arts forever. Rooted so deeply in the immediate socio-political reality of its time as well as the highly influential artistic and technological developments from the end of the 19th century, the art created between 1900 and 2000 is one that goes beyond its pure visual approach, one that hides an intellectual theory behind its mysterious fa√ßade, one that reaffirms and denies itself in unprecedented ways. It is a century that was looking for an answer to the question: What is art? through challenge, curiosity, innovation, dare, urge for change, recognition and expression.</p> <p> From the vibrant explorations of Expressionism and Fauvism, new intellectual points of view of Cubism and Constructivism, the political stance of Social Realism and the rebellion of Dadaism, to the frenetic action painting, the re-invented return of Realism, the sensational Color Field painting or the mind-boggling Op Art, the powerful simplicity of Minimalism and the celebratory critique of Pop art, to say that the century behind us was artistically exciting is a great understatement. Every movement had its famous painters, ones that still stand strong and undefeated as the ultimate creators of new ideas and that inspire generation after generation of talented individuals who embraced their legacy and continued their contribution to the evolution of contemporary art today. Their genius is still a force to be reckoned with and the very backbone of the 21st century painting.</p>
